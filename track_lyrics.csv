(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily261Embed"
Timber,"Pitbull, Kesha","1 ContributorTristesse Lyrics0
Send ""Lost In Your Complexity"" Ringtone to Mobile I'd give you the soul of this boy that is in front of you
His useless life isn't enough to beseech all your love
As you put sight in this poor boy that is ready with fear
To flourish through darkness and enter your complexity
Aching as flowers refused
Then you loose grip on emotions;
With sadness we're doomed
The frost is inside you killing you through
Burning your heart in the name of truth
In fear, we sear
Again in tears
Recall the years when fights appeared
Remember dear, those lonely years
You turn, with fear, to not see me crying here
Why? Why does your sun shine this way?
Say no more, cast me to die just today
Fighting within
Our quest tastes like an open wound
Now that's all over; this quest will never come through
You might also likeI can't wait for any answers
I'm so lost to go any further
Man might never know for sure
The complex equations of love and truth
(So) face the abnormal strength within you
Just when you loose the chance to choose

Master manipulator
God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied
And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
No, I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind

And now you got me thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changing you is possible
No, love is never logical

You built a giant castle
With walls so high I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh

And now you got me thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changing you is possible
I guess love is never logical
The sky is green, the grass is red
And you mean all those words you said
I'm sure that girl is really your friend
Our problems are all solvable
'Cause loving you is loving every

Argument you held over my head
Brought up the girls you could have instead
Said I was too young, I was too soft
Can't take a joke, can't get you off
Oh, why do I do this?

I look so stupid thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changing you is possible (Ah, ah)
No, love is never logical
Logical, logical
Love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible
And that makes me feel horrible
Oh, logical, logical
Love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all
God, why didn't I stop it all?
Oh, logical, logical
Love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible
And that makes me feel horrible
Oh, logical, logical
Love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all
God, why didn't I stop it all?8Embed"
Beautiful Things,Benson Boone,"35 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschPortuguêsEspañolNorsk (bokmål / riksmål)FrançaisBeautiful Things Lyrics
For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take

If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Please stay

Fly Away,Tones And I,"26 ContributorsFly Away Lyrics
I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away

I've been on my own for a minute
Is it only me out here?
Searching for the place to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standing on the line I was given
People staring at me while I'm here
No one seems to think that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them

No, 'cause I don't wanna be like them
'Cause I know that I, know that I

I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh
(Fly away, fly away)
Woah, woah, I'd fly away

But I was scared that if I tried, I'd fall
So whеre do I go now that I'm in it?
I never thought it'd be like this
Dreaming all my life and I did it
Thought the grass is greener than it is

'Cause I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh
Woah, oh (Fly away, fly away)

Someone Like You,Adele,"167 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolΕλληνικάفارسیDeutschالعربيةFrançaisSomeone Like You Lyrics
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you

Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
Me
Who's gonna know you? (Who?)

And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots

I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright

We can't be friends

You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite

Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need

Maybe it's the way you say my name
Maybe it's the way you play your game
But it's so good, I've never known anybody like you
But it's so good, I've never dreamed of nobody like you

And I've heard of a love that comes once in a lifetime
And I'm pretty sure that you are that love of mine

'Cause I'm in a field of dandelions
Wishin' on every one that you'd be mine, mine
And I see forever in your eyes
I feel okay when I see you smile, smile

Wishin' on dandelions all of the time
Prayin' to God that one day you'll be mine
Wishin' on dandelions all of the time, all of the time

I think that you are the one for me
'Cause it gets so hard to breathe
When you're looking at me, I've never felt so alive and free
When you're looking at me, I've never felt so happy

But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines (Ah-ha) working that Photoshop (Ah-ha)
We know that shit ain't real, come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty, beauty (Ah-ha), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top

Yeah, my momma, she told me, ""Don't worry about your size""
(Shoo-wop, wop, shoo-wop, wop)
She says, ""Boys like a little more booty to hold at night""

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?

Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo
I don't want to be afraid, the deeper that I go
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies become your legacy
Promise me a place, in your house of memories

Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I think of you from time to time more than I thought I would
You were just too kind and I was too young to know
That's all that really matters, I was a fool

Those thoughts of past lovers, they'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe you'd never wrong me
Then will you remember me in the same way as I remember you?

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do

I don't care about the government, and I really need a hug
I feel stupid (Stupid), ugly (Ugly), pretend it doesn't bother me
I'm not very strong, but I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs

It's getting cold down here underneath the weather
I skipped class to sit with you, I really like your spotty sweater
If ladybugs are girls, how do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world? I bet it's just so much better

I just turned fourteen
And I think this year I'm gonna be mean

Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary
I punch my walls, stay out at night and I do karate
Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her

But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts

You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got

And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Ripping all the skin from off my bones

I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Is it obvious you're all I had?
And the last year's been like hell
Guess I'm lonely thinkin' that you ain't moved on
And I'm sorry if I'm comin' off too strong
Never thought I'd see the shape of pain
Standin' in the front porch light
Is it obvious I'm not okay?
Never meant to start a fight
Guess I'm just a moment livin' in your past
But I never thought you'd forget me so fast

'Cause I'm starin' at all these photographs
I guess the good things ain't meant to last
I gave you forever, you gave a month
I've never fallen for anyone
And now I'm looking at the ceilin'
Wonderin' just what you're feelin' now
If that's what love's about
Then I'm so good without

Do you remember happy together?
I do, don't you?
Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach
Is that still true?

You said, ""forever,"" in the end I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called
And said, ""I miss you""
I caught it

Good to each other, give it the summer
I knew, you too
But I only saw you once in December
I'm still confused

You said, ""forever,"" and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise
Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

Dreamin' in a world that we both know

But if shit hits the fan, we're not alone

If the tide takes California

And if the sky falls from Heaven above
Oh, I know I had the best time fallin' into love
We've been livin' on a fault line
And for a while, you were all mine
I've spent a lifetime givin' you my heart
I swear that I'll be yours forever, 'til forever falls apart
'Til forever falls apart

So this is it, that's how it ends
I guess there's nothing more romantic than dyin' with your friends
And I'm not sorry for myself
I wouldn't want to spend a minute lovin' anybody else

Bored,Billie Eilish,"128 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeРусскийBored Lyrics
Ah, ah

The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run, ah

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? (I need)
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah

Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored

Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need

I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
Forget about it
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it103Embed"
