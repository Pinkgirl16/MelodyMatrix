(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
See Olivia Rodrigo LiveGet tickets as low as $44You might also like
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

(Ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily261Embed"

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spеll it out

A-B-C-D-E, fuck you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll nеver see again

And I was tryna be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood

And I think this year I'm gonna be mean

I punch my walls, stay out at night and I do karate

Never stolen by nobody

And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus

I woke up this mornin' and I sat up straight in bed
I had the strangest feeling of this weight off of my chest
I hadn't felt that hopeful since the day that you left
And it felt nice, so nice
And everybody told me it would happen in time
The fire would burn out and all the storm clouds'd subside
And I always believed that it was some comforting lie
But it feels nice, so nice

'Cause I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
And I can't even remember what made me lose all that sleep
I criеd a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a strangеr I know everything about, ooh, ooh

Made a pot of coffee and I poured myself a cup
I thought of all the things I did to try and win your love
How did that happen? I can't imagine ever doing all that stuff for just some guy
Like, you're just some guy
Oh, but I hope that you're happy, babe, you know I really do
And God knows that I am the girl I am because of you

A wet dream just dangling
But your gift is wasted on me

I spilled beer on your friend, I'm not sorry

We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
We jumped, never asking why
We kissed, I fell under your spell
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I will always want you
I can't live a lie, running for my life

I came in like a wrecking ball
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me

I put you high up in the sky
And now, you're not coming down
It slowly turned, you let me burn
And now, we're ashes on the ground

Introduced me to your family
Watched my favorite shows on your TV
Made me breakfast in the mornin'
When you got home from work

Makin' plans to travel 'round the world
Said we'd always put each other first
Old love songs we used to play to
Funny, now I hate you

Now, I
Remember when you'd call me late at night
I gave you my hours and advice just tryna fix you
And all your daddy issues
But now, I don't even miss you anymore
So, I
I want all the tears back that I cried
All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed

Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions
Now I wish I would have listened

Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches

If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams, become a taboo
I don't want to be afraid, the deeper that I go
It takes my breath away, soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes, is this taboo?

Baby, we built this house on memories
Take my picture now, shake it 'til you see it

Promise me a place, in your house of memories

ballad of a homeschooled girl,Olivia Rodrigo,"93 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaTürkçePortuguêsEspañolFrançaisالعربيةУкраїнськаLietuviųDeutschItalianoBahasa IndonesiaPolski​ballad of a homeschooled girl Lyrics
Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood runnin' cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside, it's social suicide
It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide

Ah, ah, ah

I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (Uh-huh)
Sеarchin' ""how to start a conversation?"" on a website (How to flirt?)
I talkеd to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like, the whole night (Oh)
Everythin' I do is tragic (Oh)
Every guy I like is gay (Oh)
The morning after I panic (Oh)
Oh, God, what did I say? (Oh, oh, oh)

You kept me as your favourite secret
And I thought we just took it slow
They said your girlfriend's from the beaches

I feel like you feel nothing, that's fine

And stopped wasting mine

Crazy to think that you still call me psycho
You wanna talk? Not ideal

And you've got a girl, but you still call mе psycho

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (One, two, three)

Boom Clap,Charli XCX,"74 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsBoom Clap Lyrics
You're picture-perfect blue
Sunbathing under the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
You take me over, you're the magic in my veins
This must be love

Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now
Boom clap, the sound of my heart
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
Boom clap, you make me feel good
Come on to me, come on to me now

No silver or no gold
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
Just tell me what to do
I'll fall right into you
We're going under cast the spell, just say the word
I feel your love!

Black Magic,Little Mix,"72 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsBlack Magic Lyrics
All the girls on the block knocking at my door
Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more

Is your lover playing on your side?
Said he loves ya, but he ain't got time
Here's the answer, come and get it
At a knocked down price (Hey!)
Full of honey just to make him sweet
Crystal balling just to help him see
What he's been missing, so come and get it
While you've still got time (Hey!)

Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say

Take a sip from my secret potion, I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken, one drop should be enough
Boy, you belong to me, I got the recipe
And it's called black magic (And it's called black magic, yeah)
Take a sip from my secret potion, one taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken, it'll keep you up all night
Boy, you belong to me, I got the recipe
And it's called black magic (And it's called black magic, yeah)
