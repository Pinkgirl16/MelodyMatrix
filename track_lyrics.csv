(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
(World)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I’m wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin’ friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin’ sad
So don’t waste the time I don't have
And don’t try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you ’cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending

I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

the grudge,Olivia Rodrigo,"96 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaTürkçePortuguêsEspañolFrançaisالعربيةУкраїнськаItalianoРусскийDeutschBahasa IndonesiaPolski​​the grudge Lyrics
I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go

Misery Business,Paramore,"105 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEspañolMisery Business Lyrics
Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore, you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well, I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving


Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Woah, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Woah, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

Hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh...

Yeah, I feel I'm watered down
Whenever he's around
I put on the crown of clowns
And melt slowly to the ground
Yeah, I feel it coming on
When I've been static for too long
And an explosion comes in time
Before I go and cross the line
They say, ""You used to be so kind
I never knew you had such a dirty mind""

Well, I went to the doctors believing
The devil had control over me, and
I was finding it hard to breathe, and
Finding it hard to fight the feeling

When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room

I let go of my glass balloon

Well, baby, I give you your dirty mind

Well I, I wanna tell you a secret
You can take your double-standard love and keep it
I can't help the devil likes to make my heart a double bed
And I can't help he sometimes likes to come and rest his little head

When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room

I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me
And you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason that you're

While your world is spinning out

I'm on the roof
You're in your airplane seat
I was nose-bleedin'
Looking for life out there
Readin' your horoscope
You were just doing cocaine in my kitchen
You never listen
I hope you're missing me by now

If I was a bluebird, I would fly to you
You'd be the spoon
Dip you in honey so I could be sticking to you

Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me cursing the daylight (Ooh)
Daylight, you got me calling at all times (Ooh)
Ain't gonna sleep till the daylight (Ooh)

Out of New York
I'm on the comedown speed

We're so good at comebacks, we'll find the perfect line
Hit you with the bestest, even if it takes a lifetime
This is the comeback song (You better watch out)

Hold up, no, you didn't bow, bow
I ain't the chick to walk behind you around town
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down South
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby, oh

I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it (Uh-huh)
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby

You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, as long as you don't forget

Who got the power?
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
I got the, I got the power
Hold up, my turn

I make this look easy, tick tick, boom, like gasoline-y
Yeah, they call me Lamborghini, 'cause I know just what I'm worth
Z-z-z-zero to a hundred, b-b-body make 'em stutter
Start my engine, push the button, 'cause I'm gon' be coming first (Ow)

What Other People Say,"Sam Fischer, Demi Lovato","58 ContributorsTranslationsTiếng ViệtEspañolPortuguêsDeutschWhat Other People Say Lyrics
Thought when I grew up, I would be the same
As the ones who gave me my last name
I would not give in, I would not partake
In the same old drugs everyone else takes

I'm better than that, I'm better than that
I'm livin' my life so I go to Heaven and never come back
But look where I'm at, look where I'm at
I'm livin' the life that I said I wouldn't and wanna go back

I used to call my mom every Sunday
So she knew her love wasn't far away
But now I'm all fucked up out in LA
'Cause I care more about what other people say
I used to not take chances with God's name
But it's been so long since I last prayed
And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed
'Cause I care more about what other people say

Yeah, yeah

I wish I could shelter the boy I knew
From the constant hell I'd put him through
'Cause I'm all grown up and I'm black and blue
I could use some tape, I could use some glue

I'm better than that, I'm better than that
I should be livin' my life so I go to Heaven and never come back

I used to call my mom every Sunday
So she knew her love wasn't far away
But now I'm all fucked up out in LA
'Cause I care more about what other people say
I used to not take chances with God's name

And now I'm all fucked up and my heart's changed

So she knew her love wasn't far away (Far away)
But now I'm all fucked up out in LA (Out in LA)
'Cause I care more about what other people say (Oh yeah, what other people say)

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck

She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it (Oh)
But I'm into it (Oh), I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it (Hey!)
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said

""I'm having your baby""
""It's none of your business""
""I'm having your baby""
""It's none of your business"" (It's none of your, it's none of your—)
""I'm having your baby"" (Hey!)
""It's none of your business"" (Oh!)
""I'm having your baby"" (Hey! Hey)
""It's none of your, it's none of your—"" (Ow!)

It's New York, baby, always jacked up (Hey)
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus (Uh)
In a black dress, she's such an actress

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)

I ain't worried 'bout it

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal

I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write ""pressure"" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still, no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run

Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

You broke me first

Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're callin' me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up andRumors (feat. Cardi B),"Lizzo, Cardi B","1 ContributorToday’s Top Hits 8/13/21 (feat. Lil Nas X) Lyrics1. Lil Nas X - INDUSTRY BABY (feat. Jack Harlow)

Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable

Mercy,Shawn Mendes,"107 ContributorsMercy Lyrics

You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got
You might also like
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, yeah
